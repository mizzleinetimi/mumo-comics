**Mumo**: "What's all this spaghetti doing behind the TV?"

**Friend**: "Those are cables, Mumo. That's how we used to watch everything!"

## Panel 2

**Mumo**: "There are so many! HDMI, coaxial, component... How did anyone know which one to use?"

**Friend**: "We didn't. That's why we called tech support every week."

## Panel 3

**Mumo**: "And now? Just this tiny box?"

**Friend**: "Yep! Welcome to the streaming age. All the content, none of the cable chaos."

## Panel 4

**Mumo**: "I like this future! Though I do miss having something to blame when the TV doesn't work..."

**Friend**: "Don't worry, we still have Wi-Fi for that."
